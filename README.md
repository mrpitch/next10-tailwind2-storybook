This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It uses next.js 10, tailwindcss 2 and storybook 6.
Since storybook 6 doesn't support postcss8 for now this project uses tailwindcss2 postcss7 compatibility build. Please see [Tailwind 2 Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation#post-css-7-compatibility-build) for details.
